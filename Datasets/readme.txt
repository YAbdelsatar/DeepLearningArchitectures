Just adding the metadata file here since main wav files are too large for Github.

Dataset can be obtained here: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html

Steps to download(At least what worked for me):

1. Download all sections of the files
2. Delete the .zip extension on dev_A
3. Use 7-zip to extract all files into a single file

PS- They tell you to concatenate the file and then attempt to extract it using regular zip but that didn't work for me.

*Stores all raw data that will be used in the project
